Then, Columbia began its academic year. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> From across the Harlem River and more than a third of a mile away, the stadium lights of Columbia’s Baker Athletic Complex blare through her windows at night. She said she struggles to sleep and relax comfortably in her home, as each night the lights “illuminate everything.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Ortiz is one of hundreds of Bronx residents whose lives have been disrupted by Baker Athletic Complex light pollution. Yet, despite years of persistent tenant advocacy, residents say Columbia has done nothing. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Sima Rabinowitz and her partner were similarly unaware of the severity of the lights when they moved in to 555 Kappock in 2008. Having only seen the apartment in the daytime, they were shocked their first night to find their home bright enough to “read something without turning a light on.” In their time at 555 Kappock, Rabinowitz and her partner have lived through a variety of lighting schedules on the fields, but, she says, the last few months have been especially challenging. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “It’s very, very intense,” Rabinowitz said. “It’s very hard to relax or rest with really bright artificial light shining in your eyes. … It makes it difficult to see the television, it’s hard to sleep with a bright light shining in your eyes. … It’s just this persistent aggravation.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Before moving to 555 Kappock a year ago, Charlotte Nugent lived in Park Terrace Gardens, another residential building facing Baker Athletic Complex. Though the lights are less intense in her current apartment, she described the light at Park Terrace Gardens as “so bright that it was like broad daylight at 10 p.m.” </p> <div class="image-width"> <img src="https://spectator-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/baker-athletics/image.ab08f687.jpg"> <p class="image-caption-text"> <span class="image-credit"> Photography by Vanessa Ortiz </span> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Once Columbia Athletics began using the field more in September, Ortiz found the brightness and angle of the stadium lights particularly challenging. Though other tenants have been forced to buy blackout curtains, Ortiz said she cannot afford curtains large enough to entirely block the light. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I don’t know what was the rationale of having them up that high and pointed outward instead of downward,” Ortiz said. “It just feels invasive. And it feels rude. It feels rude to everyone that lives around here. You know, it’s like, we don’t care about you people, we only care about our students who are playing right now.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Ernece B. Kelly, who has lived in 555 Kappock for over 15 years, like Ortiz, first felt the impact of the Baker Athletic Complex lights in 2017. The lights were so disruptive to her sleep that she called 311, hoping to improve her situation. She was told that because Columbia is a private university on private property, little could be done. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> So, in 2017, Kelly reached out to Columbia on her own, with a letter explaining the challenges to her sleep and quality of life posed by the Baker Athletic Complex lights. But, she said, nothing came of it. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Next, Kelly contacted former Bronx 11th district councilperson Andrew Cohen, who addressed a letter to Athletic Director Peter Pilling. Cohen wrote that he received constituent complaints regarding Baker lighting. Again, she said no progress was made. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “It was difficult for me to get to sleep and stay asleep, so it was a personal issue,” Kelly said. “And in talking to my neighbors, I realized that this isn’t just an issue for me, but it’s an issue for many people who live on the same side of the building that I live on.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The University could not be reached for comment regarding the lighting at Baker at the time of publication. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Seeing no progress after her or Cohen’s communications, Kelly turned to her fellow residents. She drafted and distributed a petition outlining the harms of the Baker Athletic Complex’s “exceedingly strong lights shining into our homes most weeknights, affecting our quality of life!” From May to July 2018, Ernece visited each apartment facing Columbia fields. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I would ring the bell and say I’m a neighbor and I’m trying to collect names to approach Columbia University with the issue of the light being a problem for us and I got more than a hundred signatures,” Kelly said. “Most people are interested and willing to sign. And there were some people who said, ‘No, I didn’t want to get involved,’ but they were in that tiny minority.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The petition, which garnered 109 signatures, demanded Columbia “PLEASE limit [stadium light] use to those hours when there is an activity necessitating their use.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> According to the 2021 Baker Field Agreement Activities Report, the stadium lights run on timers and shut off automatically at 10:30 p.m. every day. Rabinowitz, Ortiz, Kelly, and Tsirkas all said the lights are often on while the field is empty. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “From where I am standing in the window, I can see if there’s even someone running on the track,” Rabinowitz said. “That’s how clear a vision I have of the field. And so I can see at night down there, there’s absolutely nothing happening. There’s no one running, there’s no one grooming the field in a truck, there’s no football players, there’s nothing. And it’s just the light.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In December 2018, Kelly said the building’s corporate lawyer sent a letter to associate athletics director for facilities operations and capital projects Steve Figueroa. This letter, according to Kelly, included a copy of the petition. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In 2019, 81st district assembly person Dinowitz went to 555 Kappock St. to hear tenant comments and concerns, and the Baker Athletic Complex lights were one of several topics of discussion. At this meeting, Kelly said she presented the assembly person with a copy of the petition. Still, Kelly said no progress concerning the Baker lights came from this meeting. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> After two years of contact, Kelly, board member Maria Tsirkas, and board president Bonnie Press scheduled a meeting with Community and Government Relations Director Sandra Harris in October 2019. In this meeting, Kelly presented Harris with the petition. Tskiras said in this meeting they also learned 555 Kappock was not the only building to contact Columbia with complaints of light pollution. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “We got the usual ‘Well, yes, we’re very sorry, and we’ll get back to you,’” Tsirkas said. “Of course, they never got back to us. Again, we emailed her, we called, no response.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> On behalf of 555 Kappock tenants, Press followed up with Harris via email in November 2019 and again in January and March of 2020. An email on Nov. 18, 2019 included three weeks of daily reports on the on and off times of the soccer and football field lights. Still, she received no response. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In March 2020 and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, advocacy efforts came to a halt, but even after years of effort, Kelly said she has seen no progress. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Nothing, nothing changed,” Kelly said. “We had asked for things like a retrofitting of the lights because the lights can be changed so that they focus on the field, not so much outside the field and shine into our windows. And we had asked that the lights only be on when there was activity on the field. But nothing changed. The lights still would be beaming in the middle, there’s no one on the field, no game, no single person running the track. No one.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> With the exception of a decrease during COVID-19 pandemic-related closures, Kelly said, the frequency and intensity of the lights at Columbia’s Baker Athletic Complex have not improved since 2017. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I always loved Columbia,” Ortiz said. “But I just feel like living here, I’ve lost a little bit of respect for the school because I just think it’s rude. And I think that ignoring all of these residents’—especially seniors’—petitions and requests is rude. It’s not being a good neighbor.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> After years of time, energy, and dismissal, Kelly hopes Columbia finally modifies their lighting and acknowledges the needs of the communities it impacts. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I would like Columbia to take responsibility for their lights and where they shine,and when they shine, and make it their business to assure all residents that their lights are not shining in[to] our windows,” Kelly said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Staff writer Amira McKee can be contacted at amira.mckee@columbiaspectator.com.</i> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b><i>Want to keep up with breaking news?
