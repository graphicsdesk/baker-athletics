With its last winning </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> season dating back to 1971, morale among players was low. But as the contemporary reasoning went, that was all about to change, since Lawrence A. Wien Stadium was opening that fall, replacing the rotting, wooden Baker Field with 10,500 shiny seats and a losing streak with newfound optimism. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “The sight is an awesome one,” <a href="https://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/?a=d&d=cs19840411-01.2.20&srpos=9&e=------198-en-20--1--txt-txIN-wien+stadium----1984%e2%80%93--">an April 1984 Spectator article</a> reads, anticipating the completion of the stadium. “Rising from the spot where the former wooden Baker Field once stood, a grand and new stadium is taking shape.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “More than a football stadium opens tomorrow,” <a href="https://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/?a=d&d=cs19840921-01.2.25&srpos=2&e=------198-en-20--1--txt-txIN-wien+stadium----1984%e2%80%93--">another Spectator article from September of the same year states. </a>“Coaches, players, alumni and fans expect that the day will mark the opening of a new and more successful chapter in Columbia football.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Now, 38 years later, a different part of the Baker Athletics Complex is due for an upgrade: the Dick Savitt Tennis Center. Built in 2002, the facility is considered outdated and out of touch with the University’s athletic needs, much like Baker Field was in the 1980s. The demolition of the Dick Savitt Tennis Center and construction of a new facility in its stead is part of an ongoing process to modernize Baker, which is located in Inwood, Manhattan and occupies 21 acres of northern Manhattan. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Construction by the University often creates friction with the local community—the <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/04/11/cba-educational-benefits-scarcely-known-within-west-harlem-community-members-say/">Manhattanville expansion in Morningside Heights and West Harlem</a> has, for example, long been a source of tension. The building of the new tennis center, however, has gone relatively smoothly, according to Sandra Harris, the associate vice president of government and community affairs at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center and Eleazar Bueno, the chairman of Community Board 12, which covers Washington Heights and West Harlem. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Whenever we have these University projects, [I] make sure … that we bring the community to the table in a timely manner,” Harris said. “Making sure that they know exactly what is going to happen in their own communities.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Harris serves as a liaison between faculty members and the community and has developed relationships with many community organizations and engages with a host of issues, from housing, to food security, to Columbia-related plans. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> According to Harris, the University brought CB12 into talks about the tennis center early on in the project. The University revealed the plans for the new center at a CB12 Land Use Committee meeting on June 7, with the updated structure slated to open this fall. The new building is in the same footprint as the Dick Savitt Tennis Center and will rise less than 15 feet higher than the old facility. Additionally, it is being built “as of right,” which means that it complies with all zoning regulations and does not need to get supplemental approval from local community boards. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Though the new building will be built on the same plot of land as the now-obsolete Dick Savitt Tennis Center, its construction impacts Inwood residents, as Columbia’s decisions regarding Baker have long rippled out into the northern Manhattan community. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Ronald Blum, CC ’83, was a sports reporter for Spectator during his time at Columbia and wrote about a slate of renovations being made at Baker Field in the 1980s, which included both the construction of Wien Stadium and the potential sale of five acres of Baker land to Presbyterian Hospital, a matter of great controversy at the time. Some maintained that the sale violated the terms of the initial agreement regarding Baker’s land. In 1921, the financier George Baker gifted the University $700,000 to buy the property “on the sole condition that it is used for the purposes which you described to me,” which was athletics. In 1984, however, Columbia sold the land, on which Presbyterian built a 300-bed community hospital. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> While plenty of University students opposed the sale—<a href="https://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/?a=d&d=cs19840217-01.2.8&srpos=8&e=------198-en-20--1--txt-txIN-------">a 1984 Spectator editorial argued that the entire field was an integral part of Columbia’s athletic past and future</a>—many Inwood residents were also against it, as Blum reported. According to <a href="https://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/?a=d&d=cs19821206-01.2.39&srpos=17&e=------198-en-20--1--txt-txIN-------">an article he wrote in 1982,</a> community activists delivered over 1,000 letters written by “alumni, students, faculty, and neighbors” opposing the sale to the University. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/09/nyregion/hospital-trying-to-buy-5-acres-of-baker-field.html">The New York Times reported</a> that many residents supported the construction of a community hospital, but worried that building it at Baker would cause parking problems, a fear that Blum remembers well. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “You find, especially in the community, the main fear is traffic and the impact on the community,” Blum, who grew up in Inwood, said. Yet, he does not believe that students were generally attuned to the questions that community members were raising in the 1980s or that they are generally attuned to those questions now. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “The athletes for the most part took the bus up at two, had practice on the field, then went back down,” Blum said. “On campus, Columbia then and now is really divorced from the community in large respects.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Indeed, the relationship between Columbia and the Inwood community is not only characterized by less interaction with students but also by a different type of intimacy with faculty, which is illustrated in the construction of the new tennis center. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Harris was raised in Washington Heights and has worked with the Inwood community and its stakeholders for the past 35 years. In that time, she has developed personal connections with many community leaders and is working to build what she calls “mutually beneficial relationships.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “It’s a very intimate relationship with our community members,” Harris said. “And I say intimate because a lot of times they know that I’m going to share the truth. … They also feel comfortable coming to the table and saying, ‘You know, Sandra, we … disagree.’” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Among those “at the table” is Bueno, who has lived in Washington Heights for 20 years; his main job, he says, is to make sure that his community benefits from any decision Columbia makes. When it comes to communicating about and with Columbia, Harris is his main point of contact. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “There’s some confidence and trust factor, and that is Sandra,” Bueno said. “She’s been a good ally. She’s born [here], so she knows our wants and needs.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The relationship between Harris and Inwood residents, including Bueno, seems to be markedly different than that between the University and the Morningside Heights community, which many residents associate with<a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/04/11/cba-educational-benefits-scarcely-known-within-west-harlem-community-members-say/"> murky communication and a lack of trust</a> rather than sustained dialogue. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Harris said that when residents have concerns—mainly revolving around traffic and construction noise, consistent with what Blum identified as contentious in the 1980s—they generally reach out to her, creating what Bueno described as “integrative and collaborative” communication. Some were likewise concerned about the lighting on the roof of the new center, which will house the six outdoor courts, as lighting at the football field has also been an issue. The tennis center lights, however, will largely reflect into the water, rather than at residential buildings. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Aware of the concerns, Harris updates community members about the construction schedule every two weeks; she explained that since Columbia hires its own contractors, the school is able to stipulate the precise hours during which they work. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Bueno has not heard many complaints about traffic or construction times and is confident that he would have heard had there been significant issues. Yet, he does not attribute the smooth construction and communication to the University, which he describes as “abstract,” but rather to Harris herself. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “[Corporations] don’t speak, they don’t feel, they don’t have any emotions,” Bueno said. “They’re not humans, they’re entities. Therefore, they’re always going to look out for their own interest. … So the key has been to have a person that humanizes the processes. When you humanize, … things work to the benefit of the communities.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> All spaces in Baker are available for community use, and organizations will often host events, like school field days and the Inwood Film Festival, at these facilities. Yet, despite the technical accessibility of facilities like the tennis center, some wonder whether Columbia’s presence in Inwood is largely relevant to residents’ lives. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Chris Acosta, SEAS ’25, is from Washington Heights and questions if Baker is actually accessible to community members. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Columbia, the football stadium, is only for Columbia,” Acosta said. “I never see other people in it. … If you’re going to make something, I think it would be really nice … at least make it that kind of public area.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Bueno, despite the positive relationship he has with Harris, agrees that Baker facilities do not always cater to residents’ interests. While the new tennis center will offer memberships, just as the Dick Savitt Tennis Center did, he questions whether many community members will buy one, as few are particularly invested in tennis. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I’m not going to say this is purposely exclusive,” Bueno said. “What I am going to say is that Columbia is an Ivy League school, so they are going to develop and sponsor and promote the sports program that caters to the people they want.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The construction of a new tennis center at Baker has not only illuminated the potential efficacy of engaging in hyper-local, interpersonal relationships with residents, but also raised new considerations about Baker’s impact. Though the new tennis facility will occupy the same land as the Dick Savitt Center, the renewed focus on Baker—which the University has been upgrading throughout the past decade—-raises questions about Columbia’s current and future presence in Inwood. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Washington Heights, you see, is already pretty segregated,” Acosta said. “If you start building this whole Columbia thing, [many of the] people that live there … are going to be crammed into this not-so-great space while Columbia is taking up all of the nice space.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Deputy City News Editor Alice Tecotzky can be contacted at alice.tecotzky@columbiaspectator.com.
